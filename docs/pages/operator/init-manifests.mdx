Starting in version 0.8.0, vcluster allows users to apply manifests as soon as the vcluster is started. This can be useful for users configuring internal vcluster resources.

This can be configured via `helm` values:

```yaml
init:
  manifests: |-
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    ...
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    ...
```
